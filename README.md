## Description
This project was an assignment at Hack Reactor to develop and attach the front end of an e-commerce web app to an existing API and backend. The goal was to deliver a fully functional web application that met the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. 
By working collaboratively with three other developers on a single code base, my team and I integrated our newly created front end with an existing API, followed git workflow, utilized scrum and agile methodologies via Trello to meet given deadlines, and finally demonstrated our working deployed application by way of AWS:EC2 at the end of the project timeline.
